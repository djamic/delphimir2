Come here pal!\
I have been waiting for you a long time...\
It's your destiny you never escape from it even after you\
die... Ah friend, Will you take my orders and get through\
the hard way?\ \

[@next]
#IF
#SAY
Well, this is my duty. This is why I have waited for you\
instead of leaving here. You came here with a JadeCrystal.\
My name is Abel, and my nickname was Thunderman before I\
died. Originally I had striven for martial art training\
since I was 5 years old. When I was 30 years old, I was\
never scared of anyone in the world. Then I was arrogant\
for I took a pride in my martial art. Consequently it\
made me a lot of enemies. But I was no longer\
interested in community life.\ \

[@next1]
#IF
#SAY
For a very long time I searched for this monster. I searched\
the forests, the rivers and everywhere I could think of. Eventually\
I finally arrived here at Red Moon Valley's deepest room.\
I saw the ooze all around the monster.\
The monster roared crazily with all it's anger.\
I was scared now.\
But this monster had formidable strength and it was very dangerous.\ \
<Next/@next2>

[@next2]
#IF
#SAY
Yes, I had collected a lot of the treasure from the Red Moon Evil,\
I had picked up the BloodSword, but because it took so long\
to cross the rivers and lakes, it was not in very good condition.\
Because I had the sword, I was attacked by all the servants\
of the RedMoonEvil. When I reached the broken pass, I was faced\
with a great danger, then I saw the great river of blood,\
the bodies were piled high, the stench of blood filed my head.\
I was feeling arogant, because I had the sword....\ \
<Next/@next3>

[@next3]
#IF
#SAY
I was snatching as much treasure as I could hold. While this was\
happening the RedMoonEvil was killing people and there were bodies\
everywhere. People were mutually massacred, the corpses filled in the\
entire valley, rivers of blood... It is worth rejoicing that I had managed\
to find the BloodSword.\ \
<Next/@next4>

[@next4]
#IF
#SAY
All I felt was hatred, hatred for the RedMoonEvil. It had\
destroyed many a great warrior, I fought my way towards it.\
I stabbed at it with my sword, driving it into its heart.\
I felt the evil of the bloodsword consume my body, its power\
corrupting my every tought. I had to try and defeat its power.\
I was carrying the bloodsword and the fragment of it that i had\
found. Beware, for the bloodsword clouds the minds of the\
innocent, and they turn to evil.\ \
<Next/@next5>

[@next5]
#IF
#SAY
Although the RedMoonEvil had defeated me, my attack\
left a piece of the bloodsword embedded into its heart.\
For that very reason, it has never recovered completely,\
and if you listen to what I tell you, then you will be able\
to kill the beast yourself.\ \
<Next/@next6>

[@next6]
#IF
#SAY
The RedMoonEvil created the BloodSword to turn those who bore it to turn evil.\
Though, I embedded the BloodSwordPiece into its heart.\
The RedMoonEvil had massacred hundreds of great warriors.\
But still, warriors battled to reach its lair, just to try and defeat it.\
I was the first to discover a BloodBword, I used it against its creator.\
But the price for my crusade was a great one, I payed with my life.\
For a while, my body and soul were together in harmony.\
I am too old to continue my search for the BloodSwordPiece, you my friend\
must continue my search for me.\ \
