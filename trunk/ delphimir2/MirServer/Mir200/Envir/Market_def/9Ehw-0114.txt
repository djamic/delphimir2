What are you doing here in my house?\
I don't seem to know who you are.\
Are you sure you are in the right place?\ \

[@Q707]
You have not already received the book? If you have received the book,\
to learn this basic sword technique double click mouse left key,\
on the book. If you have already learned this skill, you can make your\
ability increase the hit probability. The more times you hit the probability\
will rise. Now if you go to the Province bookstore the bookstore's master\
can give you better books. The bookstore's co-ordinates are 323:247 you\
should go there.\ \
