[@main]
This is terrible! I'm Stanley, an archaeologist, looking for\
artefacts of the Oma leader. My friend, Percy, got lost and now\
I can't find him anywhere! We heard a few strange noises from the\
deeper caverns but I've lost my torch and I'm too afraid to go\
after him into the darkness. The air in here is stale, and you\
only have an hour before it becomes poisonous, and teleport back\
outside. Will you try to find Percy and bring him to safety?\ \
