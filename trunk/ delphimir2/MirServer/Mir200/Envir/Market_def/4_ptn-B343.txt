[@talk]
I used to live in a mud hut in the mountain\
with my grandpa but he hurt his back a while ago\
so we came into the castle and lived here since then.\
Since I've worked with many things that are related to\
herbs. I have been naturally exposed to the art of\
poison making. What? My grandpa? He is the one\
who is selling drugs.\ \
