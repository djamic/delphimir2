Sorry, you are too high leveled for my\
challenge.\ \
<Ok/@exit>

[@toolow]
I'm sorry, but the task I wish to offer you\
is too dangerous for someone of your skill level.\
I suggest you train more and come back to me.\
<Ok/@exit>

[@main-2]
Welcome, I see you have heard my advertisment\
that has been circulating, and that you are here\
for my challenges.\
I think with your skill and the help of others,\
you can take this challenge.\
Make sure you are completely prepared to enter my arena.\
Great danger awaits you.\
<Next/@next>

[@next]
Are you sure you are completely ready, I will let you enter.\
You can stay in for a period of 2 hours.\
If you want to leave earlier, take a dungeon escape with you.\
I wish you good luck and hope to see you here again.\
