#SAY
Do you want to buy any drug? I used the local ingredients\
for making them instead of the ones from the Main land\
but the effect will be almost the same.\ \

#SAY
The traditional method of potion making is quite\
vunerable to rotting so you should drink the drug\
as soon as you take the lid off. So i want to develop\
a drug that does not easily get spoilt.\ \
