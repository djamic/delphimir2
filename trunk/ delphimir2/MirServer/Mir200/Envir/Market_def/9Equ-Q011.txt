How did you come here? You're great, then you\

scholar, the reverend Poki.\

#SAY
Listen carefully! There are 3 big TacticalMazes inside\
I either can not distinguish between those, but as far as I know\
one TacticalMaze follows the principle of a holy book from an ancient\
kingdom name by 'Ko-Jo-Sun'.\
It turns by the rotation of Jin->Son->Kam->Gon->Lee->Tai->Gun->Gan->Jin\
Do you want to know more? Then you should pay me 5,000 gold..\ \

Another TacticalMaze turns clockwise on the basis of Taikuk 8 Koai-Jin\
in rotation of Lee->Gon->Tai->Gun->Kam->Gan->Jin->Son->Lee\

You want to know the direction of TacticalMaze? Then I shall tell you.\
Listen carefully..\
The direction of Lee is toward 12 o'clock , the direction of Gon is toward 1 o'clock,\
The direction of Jin is toward 9 o'clock , the direction of Son is toward 11 o'clock,\
I don't remeber the rest directions at the moment.\
Why don't you look for those by yourself..\
