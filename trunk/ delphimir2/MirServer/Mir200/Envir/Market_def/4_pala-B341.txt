Welcome to Castle Gi-Ryoong.\
This castle has most facilities you could want\

<Listen/@list1> to the history of the castle\
<Listen/@list2> to the newly discovered cave\
<Close/@exit>

[@list1]
#SAY
This castle was built for suppressing the monsters, which\
have been found massing near Woomyon Woods and marauding\
through villages. Also it has the role of guarding the path\
which will soon open to the west. So the castle was built\
with thorough plans and has all the necessary facilities to\
be a top class fortress.\ \

#SAY
However, the reinforcements from the other Walls are\
few and our reserves are dangerously low.\
Furthermore, there are new unexpected threats that\
constantly appear around the castle. We desperately\
need help from people like you.\ \

#SAY
The court is even considering the option to let the young\
and brave people like you to run the castle. So please be\
concerned about the castle. I really hope that the authorities\
and the people come togeather and unite on all issues to\
overcome current difficulties.\ \

It was when the construction of the castle\
was just completed. Our soldiers began mopping up\
the monsters by using the castle as a base.\
The first few days went smoothly but soon the\
soldiers on the patrol duty stopped returning to the castle.\ \
<Next/@next4>

[@next4]
#SAY
Even the search and rescue team for the\
missing soldiers never returned. The military intelligence\
thought there must be massive forces of unknown monsters.\
So we began searching the posts where the soldiers disappeared.\
Finally, we discovered traces of the missing soldiers\
leading towards one very mysterious cave.\ \

General Bigmace, who was in charge of the castle at that\
time, led 70% of the Gi-Ryoong garrison to the cave to\
defeat the evil forces.\
And.... that was the time I last saw him.\
Most of the expeditionary troop including the general were\
annihilated in the cave and only few managed to escape.\ \

#SAY
Dragon's vein.. It is called Dragon's vein.\
Thousands of soldiers got slaughtered and in return our\
scholars were only able to discover that single name. Can\
you believe that? Even more.. there is no one who knows\
what is really inside that cave. However, the most worrying\
thing of all is we are in deep trouble since we lost 70% of our\
garrison and are surrounded by the monsters we were supposed\
to hunt down.\

The monsters, which lost their strongholds to us, are trying\
to take advantage of the situation and looking for an\
opportunity to destroy the castle. Phew ....So we desperatley\
need help from people like you.\ \
