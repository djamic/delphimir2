[@buy]
You want to buy a weapon?\
Hmmm, choose what you want.\
I assure you they are all fine weapons....\ \ \
<Back/@main>

[@sell]
We will buy any weapon.\
There won't be any rip-off or special bargain but\
only fair deal.\ \ \
<Back/@main>

[@repair]
If you do the normal repair, the durability\
of the weapon will drop a bit.\
So you still want that?\
If you want the special repair, go to Wayne.\ \

[@talk]
Castle Gi-Ryoong is built in an isolated area\
but the traffic of trade goods is not so light here.\
Considering it was originally built\
for a purely military use,\
it is lucky to have this degree of prosperity here.\
However, we always lack the mineral ore to make weapons.\ \
