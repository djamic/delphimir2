They are all made of fine fabrics imported from the mainland\
and the quality is absolutely guaranteed.\
Have a look and take your time.\ \

Please show me the clothes you want to sell.\
I'll pay you more, if the quality of the cloth is good.\ \

I'll show the skills earned from 20 years of sewing experience.\
Ok..just give it to me. I'll repair just like new.\ \

#SAY
If I can, I want to go to the mainland and live there.\
No doubt, everyone in the village will think the same as me.\
Only mere Emily has not thought about that.\ \
