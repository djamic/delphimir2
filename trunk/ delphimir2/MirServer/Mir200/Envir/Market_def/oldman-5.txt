There are some things that you should know if you want to\
timetravel back to the past. if your level is 40 or higher,\
then you will be able to go back to the paast by your own.\
For the people below level 40, it is simply impossible.\ \
<Is there still anyway?/@travel>\

[@travel]
;#SAY
If you really want to go back to the past, possess a piece\
of TimeStone. This piece of stone will help you to\
timetravel back to the past. But if your level is below 33,\
you can not timetravel even with the stone. I know it is\
expensive. If you don't want to buy it, try the drops from\
monsters. It may take some time but you can save money...\
