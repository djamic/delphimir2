[B]Firstly you need to download a full new client from here http://senture-mir.com/Heroes/HeroesClient20-10-11.zip . This is required. You will not be able to get ingame until you update to this client[/B]

[B]Combo Skills[/B]

Combo skills is a Shanda system were certain skills run together in a combo with a chance of hitting a critical strike

To use
- Find page in State Window (F10), Double Click top boxes to equip skill
- Use with Ctrl+D
- Delay etc can be set in !Setup -> SerieMagicTime
- Need at least 2 skills to have a combo

For Warrior: ThreeLore, HeartStab, MountainBreak, Annihilation
For Wizard: DragonBreak, PhoenixDance, ThunderBurst, IceAndSnow
For Taoist: TigerTactics, EightPalm,ThreeFlameCurse,ThousandSword

You can no longer use the above skills as normal Skills. I'm not sure what will happen to players that already have those skills learnt. They should appear in the new menu but if they don't you'll need to script an NPC to check they have the skill, remove it and then give it back to them. Hopefully it's not needed.

[B]Other updates - Thanks Ryan![/B]
