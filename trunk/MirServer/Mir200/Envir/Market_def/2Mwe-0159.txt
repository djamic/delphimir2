[@qweapon]
The weapon bought from this store has some capacity limit,\
but weapons aquired from monsters sometimes have special stats.\
If you bring that special weapon to us we'll buy it at a higher price.\
By the way, don't forget that the weapon price differs with its stats\
Usually the higher the durability the higher the selling price.\ \
