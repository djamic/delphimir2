The mainland is so big, its boundries are limitless.\
He who does not know the road,\
You will be glad of what I know,\
<Co-Ordinates/@xy>,\
Is your journey <slow/@speed>?\

[@xy]
You are currently in the biggest city, I am not sure of the coordinates!\
There is a small village in Serpent Valley, is easy to find, so long\
as you walk towards 500:500, you can find it easily,\
But if you wish to arrive at Bichion, you should head for 300:300\
Keep this in mind, it will point you in the right direction.\
If you are heading for mongchon, there lies great danger...\ \
<Back/@main>

[@pk]
Beware, for in Mongchon lies the death camp,\
where those who commit murder are exiled.\
If you meet a murderer, be careful, for although\
they are exiled, the lust for murder still flows through them.\
The murderers, will be exiled on death. They shall spend their days\
in death camp. If they change their shameful ways, they shall be allowed free,\
murderers will lose their items when they die.\ \

[@speed]
If you believe your speed to be slow, there are many\
reasons for this, you're network may be insufficient, causing\
your connection to be slower. If this happens to you, please\
feel free to fill in a speed test at www.mir2.com.cn, then we\
can work on getting a faster network\
as soon as possible, your regional server maybe upgraded.\ \
<Back/@main>

[@talkwith]
Do you not have the time to walk? Or are the lands of Mir too\
dangerous for you to cross by foot?\
I can transport you to places you want to go. It's actually quite simple,\
as long as you have the money I need.\ \
