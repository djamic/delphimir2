[@main]
Am I glad to see you! I am Percy, Stanley's colleague and partner.\
I have a terrible sence of direction and, stupidly, got lost within\
these caves. I have to stay, but I've found a portal that will take\
one person up outside the Tomb. You can go now, or, if you're\
feeling brave, stay here with me and look for clues!\ \
