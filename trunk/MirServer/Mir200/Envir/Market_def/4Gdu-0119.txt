<$USERNAME>, The medicine is not completed still.\
Please do not rush me,  When the medicine is completed, it will be\
very powerful. But if the medicine is completed too early.....then I\
would hate to think what would happen. I cannot work at nightime,\
I need to sleep.

[@ok_h_order]
I am very grateful my friend, the medicine is being made. It\
contains the key to creating the best medicine. The medicine\
that is created will probably be of the highest standard....\
I dont want to sell this drug store, I will not let it go out\
of business, my friend owes me a favour. He may be able to help.\
I have some good news about the teacher, it is old news\
but in essence it is important..... My friend is beautiful, but looks\
are only as important as knowledge.\
