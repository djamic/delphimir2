I'm dispatched from the Bichon Wall,\
preventing the crossed force from Bottomless Pit breaking out..\
It may sound simple,but as a matter of fact,very difficult.\
The monsters attempt to break the seal endlessly.\ \
<We intend to protect the seal as well../@next>\ 
<I understand/@exit>

[@next]
What? Do you know what kind of danger you are stepping into?\
Even if it is to slay the monsters in BichonWall,\
I cannot get involved in such nonsense.\ \
<I do wish to get rid of these monsters./@next2>\
<Is that so?/@exit>

[@next2]
Okay if you sat so, I must test your power.\
first,organize the members into a group with three:\
Warriors,Sorcerers,and Taoists Come with exactly 9 of you here.\
Then i'll test how well they are united.\
You will find the orbs in Prajna Island.\
All members will hand over the orbs to the party leader,\
and the leader needs to talk to me when ready with orbs.\ \
<I am ready/@next3>
