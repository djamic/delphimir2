[@main]
I was here to learn martial arts skills but I have practiced\
laundering and sewing instead of martial art skills.\
It's not bad as I made money with selling extra clothing and\
charging for repairs. Well, what do you want?\ \
<Buy/@buy> armour.\
<Sell/@sell> armour.\
<Repair/@repair> armour.\

[@buy]
What item do you want to buy?\ \ \
<Back/@main>

[@sell]
Show me your clothes to be sold. I'll give you an appraisement.\
We also trade helmets.\
So if you like my store please sell them to me.\ \
<Back/@main>

[@repair]
You can repair clothes and helmets here.\ \ \
<Back/@main>

[~@repair]
It seems repaired fine.\ \ \
