#SAY
According to the legend, 1000 years ago there was an\
epic war,to decide the fate of this world. It happened\
right here on this Island...The evil forces from their\
dark,underground lair rose from the earth, using the\
Island as a channel to invate the World.\ \
<Next/@next1>

[@next1]
#SAY
However, mighty heroes appeared, who bravely fought and\
defeated the evil forces after many fierce battles.\
These heroes sealed the path that led to the gateway of\
the Evil.\ \
<Next/@next2>

[@next2]
#SAY
Later, these heros built a temple that was based on a maze,\
at the top of the sealed path, to block its access; however, as time\
passed, the temple became buried deep into the ground and\
no trace of it can now be found.\ \

#SAY
What? Unbelievable you say? Ha ha ha...\
of course, that's why I told you it's a Legend!\ \

[@askmons]
#SAY
I believe that the monsters spotted recently must be\
the ones mentioned in the legend. Otherwise, how can we\
explain that such things exist in the World?\
I am sure, positive, that they are the ones once defeated\
by the legendary heros, and are returning once more.\ \
<Next/@next4>

[@next4]
It is the end of the world. The end, I tell you....\
Why must something like this happen in the very twilight\
of my life?\
What a misfortune... what a sadness... bah!\ \

#SAY
The "Bottomless Pit"? Now there's something I haven't\
heard about in a very long time. It happened such a long\
time ago, so the youngsters here do not know much about\
this. Anyway, it is a true story.\ \
<Next/@next5>

[@next5]
#SAY
Long ago, there was a pit somewhere on this island.\
Whenever strange sound echoed through the pit,\
people passing there nearby\
all disappeared and never returned.\
So it was called "Bottomless Pit"\ \
<Next/@next6>

[@next6]
#SAY
And one man.. there was one man\
who came back alive. He came back covered\
all over with wounds and told us there is\
another world down there full of cruel monsters.\
He spoke some more gibberish\
we couldn't understand him and he died few days later.\ \
<Next/@next7>

[@next7]
#SAY
The frightened villagers could not bear any more\
and called a famous shaman for an exorcism.\
Maybe because of the exorcism or something\
else, never again we have experienced\
such indidents of people disappearing.\ \
<Next/@next7>

[@next7]
#SAY
That's the story and already 70 years have\
passed since then. Now no one remembers\
where the pit was but it might appear again.\
Village elders, who are aware of the incidents,\
are anxious about that.\ \
