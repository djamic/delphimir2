#SAY
From here we make new weapons\
by melting the useless old ones.\
Even though it is harder to make new weapons\
this way, and we lack the material,\
transporting the mineral ores\
from Bichon costs far too much.\ \

I really miss my home town,\
but I'm not sure when I will see it again...\ \
