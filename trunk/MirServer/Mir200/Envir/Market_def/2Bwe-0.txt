Hmm... you don't meet the standards to listen to my story.\
There is no point in taking on a quest which you cannot complete.\
Since you took the effort to get here, I will give you a present.\
Good luck.\ \

If you don't want to listen it would be a waste of time telling\
you about my story. If you ever feel like listening just come\
back and ask me\ \

[@w_t_ok]
Have you heard of the FateSword?\
I study the blacksmith technology everywhere and am\
looking for a skilled worker's time, I was young once,\
I was enthusiastic to learn the highest technology, I\
went all over the lands of Mir.\ \
<Continue/@next>

[@next]
I am Jiang Shi.\
I arrived at a town one day and noticed I was hungry. I\
found an inn and decided to enter.\ \
<Continue/@next_1>

[@next_1]
I entered the inn and called the boss. I asked to select several simple vegetables,\
but I discovered that in his hand was no common kitchen knife,\
it was all more splendid than a kitchen knife.\ \
<Continue/@next_2>

[@next_2]
I spoke to the inn keeper and found he made knives.\
Also he is no normal person, he is the high-level warrior.\
His sword technique at that time was unbelievable.\
He left the village and I couldn't find him.\ \
<Continue/@next_3>

[@next_3]
I went crazy to find him, finally I did.\
I asked him if I could be his apprentice and he allowed me.\
I was so proud that I could learn from him. But,\
I started to drink liquor and didn't pay attention. I\
regret that to this day.\ \
<Continue/@next_4>

[@next_4]
He became unhappy with me and told me to leave. He said I\
had changed and he didn't like it. I was so sorry,\
I was a failure at being a skilled worker.\
Until this day I have worked here.\ \
<Continue/@next_5>

[@next_5]
A skilled worker can make swords, but as I have not\
learned the sword technology before I cannot do it.\
Now, I am looking for a skilled worker.\
Will you accept my proposal of finding a skilled worker?\ \
<Accept/@accept>\
