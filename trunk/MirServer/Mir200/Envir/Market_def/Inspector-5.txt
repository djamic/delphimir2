Lately, a number of unidentified monsters have been seen\
lurking around here, so i've been sent to find the cause.\
According to some rumours, there is a place called the\
"Bottomless Pit" on the Island. I'm investigating\
whether that place has something to do with the monsters.\ \

#SAY
I don't actually know in great detail, but from what I heard,\
the place is haunted by mysterious forces, and because of that\
many villagers have disappeared without trace. People here are\
now calling it the "Bottomless Pit", and they have taken to\
avoiding the wilderness alone.\ \
